3D compass is a sample Android application showing how to display
a 3D arrow with OpenGL that takes its direction from the orientation
sensor.

Note that the compass direction is sometimes inaccurate--at least,
on my HTC Desire it is. However, turning the phone this way and
that will often nudge it back into a sensible reading.
