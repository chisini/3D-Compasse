3D compass is a sample Android application showing how to use a
SurfaceView to display a dynamically-updated 3D arrow with OpenGL that
takes its direction from the orientation sensor, composited on top of
a live camera preview image.

Note that the compass direction is sometimes inaccurate--at least, on
my HTC Desire it is. However, turning the phone this way and that will
often nudge it back into a sensible reading. Also I put in a fixed 90Â°
rotation compensation for the camera image in portrait mode; there are
calls at Android API level 9 to calculate this more generally, which I
have avoided using here.
